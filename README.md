Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to effectively target their customers. By using K-means clustering, we can identify distinct groups within our customer base based on various features like spending habits, age, income, and more. This project classifies data, preprocesses it, and visualizes the clusters.

The dataset used in this project can be any dataset containing customer information such as demographic details and spending behavior. Typical features include:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)
